Loan Eligibility Prediction


This repository contains code for a machine learning project that predicts loan eligibility based on customer data. The project is implemented using Python and popular libraries such as Scikit-learn and Pandas.

Overview


The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will be eligible for a loan based on various features such as gender, marital status, education, income, and credit history.
